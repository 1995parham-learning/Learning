## Introduction

I used this repository for learning and testing new technologies and languages.
There are many libraries and projects out there that need a try, so I give them shot here.

After many years that I had used this repository, I decided to create an organization
and then put these materials into different repository, then I created [1995parham-learning](https://github.com/1995parham-learning/).

Also, you can use this repository history to find out about the examples that were here and,
I'm not working on them anymore
