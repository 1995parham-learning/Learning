# Learning Codes
## Who Am I ?
I am simple lonely person who spent his life on code and ...
and this is what I have after many years of life ...

## Introduction
My personal learning code from C, Assembly, Python, ... collected
here. some of these code collected from
[my stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4242097/parham-alvani)
answers.
You can use these example as tutorial.

## Contribution
If you think you have such programming example you can send me [email](mailto:parham.alvani@gmail.com)
and I add them into this repository.

## Table of Code ?!
### C
Makefile is a good thing ! have this for have fun:
```Makefile
all: calc_lcm_gcd

calc_lcm_gcd: main.o gcd.o lcm.o
	$(CC) -o $@ $^ $(CFLAGS) $(LDLIBS)

%.o: %.c functions.h
	$(CC) -c -o $@ $< $(CFLAGS)

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm main.o gcd.o lcm.o calc_lcm_gcd
```

### Python
It's better to use `pyvenv` with your python code:
```sh
# Setup
pyvenv .
# Activate
. ./bin/activate
# Deactive
deactive
```
#### [Bluetooth](Python/bluetooth)
simple program for using bluetooth in python.
In order to use this code on linux you need to install `libbluetooth-dev`
package.
```sh
sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev
```
If you want to use BLE version of this library you need following dependencies:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev pkg-config libboost-dev libboost-python-dev libboost-thread-dev
git clone https://github.com/1995parham/pygattlib.git && cd pygattlib
sudo python3 setup.py install
```
If you want to access your low power bluetooth devices directly from linux shell
you can use HCI tools like this:
```sh
# First check HCI device is up and running
sudo hciconfig
# If you HCI device is down :(
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
# Let's start a scan for LE (Bluetooth LE or Bluetooth smart) devices
sudo hcitool lescan
```
#### [Flask](Python/flask)
It's a simple flask application that I had written in the day that 18.20 left me.

trash life ...

#### [eMQTT](Python/emqtt)
First up and run your [eMQTT](http://emqtt.io/) broker.

# Start emqttd
./bin/emqttd start

# Check Status
./bin/emqttd_ctl status

# Stop emqttd
./bin/emqttd stop
```
