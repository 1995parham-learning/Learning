[] -Wl,option:
Pass option as an option to the linker. If option contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas. You can use this syntax to pass an argument
to the option. For example, -Wl,-Map,output.map passes -Map output.map to the linker. When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with -Wl,-Map=output.map.

[] -static:
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared libraries. On other systems, this option has no effect.
