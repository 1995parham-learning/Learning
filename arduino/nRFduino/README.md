A wireless network using nRF24L01 and two Ardunio UNO boards.

## How to run?!
Seriously! There is no need to run this project with **npm**, etc. :|
Just hit the **download** button and copy the contents of the library folder to the **Arduino IDE library path** of your computer. You need to **Verify and Compile** SENDER's and RECEIVER's code and upload it to your arduino **UNO** boards.

## What's inside?
There is nothing more than a complete communication between two **nrf** modules using arduino **UNO**. I'll try to add more examples on using this amazing board.

## Can i contribute?
Sure! Wise pull requests will be accepted.

## How to set everything up?
Please take a look at the following page for schematics:
