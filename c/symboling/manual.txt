** gcc options
[] -Wl,option:
Pass option as an option to the linker. If option contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas. You can use this syntax to pass an argument
to the option. For example, -Wl,-Map,output.map passes -Map output.map to the linker. When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with -Wl,-Map=output.map.

[] -static:
On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking with the shared libraries. On other systems, this option has no effect.

** ld options
[]
-R filename
--just-symbols=filename :
Read symbol names and their addresses from filename, but do not relocate it or include it in the output.
This allows your output file to refer symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined in other programs. You may use this option more than once.
For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the -R option is followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is treated as the -rpath option.
